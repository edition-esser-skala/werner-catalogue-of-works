# Gregor Joseph Werner: A thematic catalogue of his works

## Folders

(Not all of these folders appear in the git repository.)

- `_book`: Quarto output
- `data`:
  - `catalogue.ods`: spreadsheet with all works and their numbers
  - `rism_entries.xml`: RISM entries with Werner as author as of 2023-01-27
  - `incipits`: manually curated incipits
- `data_generated`: output files generated by the scripts in this repository
- `renv`: R environment data
- `script`: R scripts
- `works`: QMD files generated by R scripts, one per group of works

The root folder contains the usual files required by Quarto. Notably,
- `apa-6th-edition.csl` describes the citation style, and
- `references.bib` contains all references.


## Scripts

See the *Methods* section in `index.qmd` on which scripts to run.
