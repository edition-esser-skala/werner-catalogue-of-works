# Gregor Joseph Werner: A thematic catalogue of his works

## Folders

(Not all of these folders appear in the git repository.)

- `_book`: Quarto output
- `data`:
  - `catalogue.ods`: spreadsheet with all works and their numbers
  - `rism_entries.xml`: RISM entries with Werner as author as of 2023-01-27
  - `incipits`: manually curated incipits in MEI format; one subfolder per work (`[group]_[number]`); the incipit `main.mei` is required and will be used on the group overview page; other incipits are imported in MerMEId
  - `works_html`: HTML files exported from the MerMEId HTML preview (`[group]_[number].html`)
    - `resources`: various files required for rendering these pages
  - `works_mei`: work metadata in MEI format exported from MerMEId (`[group]_[number].xml`)
- `data_generated`: output files generated by the scripts in this repository
- `groups`: QMD files generated by R scripts, one per group of works, and one page with an overview table
  - `incipits`: incipits generated from PAE code in RISM entries or from `data/incipits/[work]/main.mei`
- `images`: images used on the webpage
- `renv`: R environment data
- `script`: R scripts

The root folder contains the usual files required by Quarto. Notably,
- `apa-6th-edition.csl` describes the citation style, and
- `references.bib` contains all references.


## How to create the webpage

1. Run `script/prepare_works.R`.
2. Render the book with Quarto.
3. `cp -r data/works_html _book/works` (not necessary during preview)
4. Call rsync.
