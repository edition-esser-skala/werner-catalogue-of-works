# Gregor Joseph Werner: A thematic catalogue of his works

## Folders

(Not all of these folders appear in the git repository.)

- `_book`: Quarto output
- `data`:
  - `catalogue_overview.csv`: overall structure of the catalogue (groups and subgroups)
  - `catalogue_works.csv`:
    - all works with WerW numbers and locations
    - several sigla in a cell are separated by a pipe
    - if there are several works with an equal siglum, the last three digits of the RISM ID are appended in brackets
  - `config.yml`: script configuration
  - `instrument_abbreviations.csv`: table of instrument abbreviations and long names
  - `library_sigla.csv`: table of library sigla, names, and links
  - `rism_entries.xml`: RISM entries with Werner as author as of 2024-01-27
  - `works_in_rism.csv`: works listed in RISM as of 2024-01-27 (867 works)
  - `works_missing_in_rism.csv`: works without RISM entry, manually curated
  - `incipits`:
    - manually curated incipits in LY or MEI format
    - `header.ly` is required by LY incipits
    - one subfolder per work (`[group]_[number]`)
    - At least one main incipit (`main_1.ly` or `main.mei`) is required and will be used on the group overview page. If there are additional main incipits (`main_2.ly` etc), all of them will be included.
    - Incipits `1_[label].ly` and, if available, `2_[label].ly` etc are displayed when clicking on the main incipit(s) on a group page.
    - Incipits are also imported in MerMEId.
  - `works_mei`:
    - work metadata in MEI format exported from MerMEId (`[group]_[number].xml`)
    - download files from http://localhost:8080/apps/eXide/index.html
    - process with `script/prepare_mermeid_xml.sh`
- `data_generated`: output files generated by the scripts in this repository
- `groups`: QMD files generated by R scripts, one per group of works, and one page with an overview table
- `images`: images used on the webpage
- `incipits`: incipit images in SVG format generated from PAE code in RISM entries or from manual MEI/LY incipit source code; one subfolder per work (`[group]_[number]`)
- `renv`: R environment data
- `script`: bash, Python, and R scripts

The root folder contains the usual files required by Quarto. Notably,

- `apa-6th-edition.csl` describes the citation style;
- `references.bib` contains all references; and
- `styling.scss` customizes CSS.


## How to create the webpage

1. Create the catalogue: `Rscript script/make_catalogue.R`.
2. Create PAE sources for RISM incipits: `Rscript script/create_rism_incipits.R`.
3. Engrave all incipits: `make -f script/make_incipits.mk`.
4. Prepare webpages: `Rscript script/prepare_pages.R`.
5. Render with Quarto: `quarto render`.
6. Move generated files into the site folder: `cp -r data/works_mei _book/metadata && cp -r incipits _book` (not necessary during preview).
7. Deploy the folder `_book` via rsync, either to the folder `werner-catalogue` (released versions) or `werner-catalogue-draft` (draft versions).
