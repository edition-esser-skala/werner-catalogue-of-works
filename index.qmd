# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This page contains an evolving thematic catalogue of Gregor Joseph Werner's works. For general and biographical information on Werner, see @Czernin2020, @Moder1959, @Petermayr2007, and @Unverricht2001.


## Overview

We classify Werner's works as *Vocal music* (groups A to M) and *instrumental music* (groups N to R); moreover, an appendix contains spurious and uncertain attributions (group Z). Groups D, H, and I are further divided into subgroups to provide a more fine-grained classification and to preserve work numbering if further works are discovered. The catalogue does not cite lost works (with the exception of lost oratorios, whose existence has been sufficiently proven). Within each (sub)group, works are ordered by library and siglum; the more important libraries (H-Bn and A-Ed) appear first, followed by other libraries.

Currently, the catalogue contains the following informations for each work: title, key, sources, and one incipit. As the catalogue evolves, detailed information on each work will be added in MEI format.


## Methods

We consulted the following sources, which represent partial catalogues of Werner's works:

- @Czernin2020a – sources in Austria
- @Dopf1956 – masses
- @Harich1976 – oratorios
- @Mikusi2020 – sonatas
- @Muranyi1997 – works in the National Szechenyi Library Budapest
- @Petermayr2020 – instrumental works
- @WinklerKlement2013 – works in the Dommusikarchiv Eisenstadt
- @WinklerKlement2020 – masses and oratorios

The work list assembled from these sources (`data/catalogue.ods`) was checked against and supplemented by RISM entries. To this end, entries were downloaded via *sru-downloader* (https://github.com/rism-international/sru-downloader) on 2023-01-27, yielding 867 entries:

```bash
java -jar SRUDownloader.jar "https://muscat.rism.info/sru/sources?operation=searchRetrieve&version=1.1&query=creator=%22Werner,%20Gregor%20Joseph%22&maximumRecords=100"
```
In the resulting XML file, all tags in the `zs` namespace were removed, yielding the XML file `data/rism_entries.xml`, which only contains MarcXML tags. From this file, searchable HTML tables were created via `script/parse_rism_search_results.ipynb` and `make_rism_tables.R` and stored in `data_generated/rism_tables/`.

Pages for each group were generated automatically from `catalogue.ods`. For each work, one incipit was generated from the Plaine & Easie Code of a selected RISM entry.
