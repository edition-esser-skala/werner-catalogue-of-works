# Changelog {.unnumbered}

## 0.8.0 – 2024-09-08

### Added

- manual incipits for WerW B.1/7/33/38/40/42/47/51/52/58/S6, B.48 (Agnus Dei), D.1.8, D.3.7, E.34, J.S1, K.3, and P.3 
- metadata for WerW B.1/7/33/38/40/42/47/48/51/52/58/70/S6, C.S3, D.1.5–8/10/11, D.2.5/6, D.3.7, E.1/34/38/S1, J.S1, K.3, and P.3
- new sources for WerW I.3.3 (A-Wn F100.Moder.1/2), I.3.21 (A-Wn F100.Moder.2), I.5.20 (A-Wn F100.Moder.1/1), and P.S1 (St Peter inventory)
- a macro `\hy` to the LY incipit header, which prints a hyphen in lyrics
- a macro `\skips` to the LY incipit header, which skips notes for lyrics
- Identifiers in works details are now links to the respective reference.
- The following metadata fields are now also supported and thus included in the work details: several work titles, genre, general notes on the work level, number of voices in vocal ensemble, roles, and notes for movements.
- acknowledgements for A-GÖ
- information on currently undiscoverable A-HE sources (WerW G.11/14, I.4.2/53, and J.3)

### Changed

- The XML preparation script now converts and renames all XML files in the folder. It requires a first argument which corresponds to the catalogue of works abbreviation. Thus, `WerW_B_1.xml` is processed and renamed to `B_1.xml`.
- Parameters for R scripts are now in a YAML file (`script/config.yml`). Thereby, only this file has to be changed if the code base is reused for different projects.
- Group C has been renamed (Requiems, Libera -> Requiems). Accordingly, WerW C.5 has been renumbered to D.3.6, which has shifted former D.3.6/7 to D.3.7/8.
- WerW B.75 has been reclassified as spurious work and thus has been renumbered to B.S6. Accordingly, WerW B.76–78 have been renumbered to WerW B.75–77.
- WerW D.1.5 has been reclassified as offertory and thus has been renumbered to D.2.6. Accordingly, the following works have been renumbered: WerW D.1.6–17 to 5–16, and D.2.6–9 to 7–10.
- WerW D.1.8 has been renamed and thus could be merged with D.2.L7. Accordingly, WerW D.2.L8/9 have been renumbered to D.2.L7/8.
- WerW J.6 has been reclassified as spurious work and thus has been renumbered to J.S1. Accordingly, WerW J.7 has been renumbered to WerW J.6.

### Fixed

- identifiers in metadata of WerW B.46 and Q.2
- Ensembles are now correctly sorted (soli always before coro). Moreover, the soli ensemble is renamed to solo if only a single voice participates in a movement.


## 0.7.0 – 2024-07-30

### Added

- manual incipits for WerW B.48, F.19/20/43, I.1.1, I.2.4, I.4.35, and Q.4.
- additional MEI metadata: dating, bibliography, and notes
- references: Kiesewetter 1847, Mayer 2020, Meyer 2020, Mitterschiffthaler 1997, Paczkowski 2019, Pernerstorfer 2020, Petermayr 2015, Petermayr 2022, Pohl 1875, Rovátkay 2020, Schlader 2020, Schubert 2007, Sherman 2001, Štefan 1985, Zelenka 1739, and Petermayr's draft catalogue of works 
- The catalogue now also comprises spurious and lost works (with incipits where known).
- The catalogue now comprises four reference columns: HarIn (Hárich 1975), PetWe (Petermayr 2015), PetSi (Petermayr 2020), and WinMa (Winkler-Klement 2020). These are linked to the bibliography.
- The overview table now includes the number of total, ascertained, lost, and spurious works in each group.
- A new chapter now describes the scope of work metadata. This chapter complements the more technical guidelines, which have thus been moved to the appendix.

### Changed

- Partitas from the Instrumental-Calender now have separate entries WerW O.1 to O.12.
- Accordingly, WerW O.2 was renumbered to O.13.
- Incipits are now always displayed in SVG format (white background with rounded corners), which greatly improves their appearance on high-resolution displays.
- If MEI metadata is available for a work, all data displayed on the group page are taken from this file.
- Incipits are now specified without file extension in MEI files.
- Work details are now wider to accommodate wide tables.
- The following groups were renamed: E (German church arias -> German sacred music), I (Marian antiphons -> Marian hymns), and L (Profane cantatas -> Profane vocal music).
- The bibliography now appears on a separate page.
