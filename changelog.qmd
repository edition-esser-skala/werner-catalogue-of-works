## 0.8.0 – 2024-09-08

### Added

- manual incipits for WerW B.1/7/33/38/40/42/47/51/52/58/S6, B.48 (Agnus Dei), D.1.8, D.3.7, E.34, J.S1, K.3, and P.3 
- metadata for WerW B.1/7/33/38/40/42/47/48/51/52/58/70/S6, C.S3, D.1.5–8/10/11, D.2.5/6, D.3.7, E.1/34/38/S1, J.S1, K.3, and P.3
- new sources for WerW I.3.3 (A-Wn F100.Moder.1/2), I.3.21 (A-Wn F100.Moder.2), I.5.20 (A-Wn F100.Moder.1/1), and P.S1 (St Peter inventory)
- a macro `\hy` to the LY incipit header, which prints a hyphen in lyrics
- a macro `\skips` to the LY incipit header, which skips notes for lyrics
- Identifiers in works details are now links to the respective reference.
- The following metadata fields are now also supported and thus included in the work details: several work titles, genre, general notes on the work level, number of voices in vocal ensemble, roles, and notes for movements.
- acknowledgements for A-GÖ
- information on currently undiscoverable A-HE sources (WerW G.11/14, I.4.2/53, and J.3)

### Changed

- The XML preparation script now converts and renames all XML files in the folder. It requires a first argument which corresponds to the catalogue of works abbreviation. Thus, `WerW_B_1.xml` is processed and renamed to `B_1.xml`.
- Parameters for R scripts are now in a YAML file (`script/config.yml`). Thereby, only this file has to be changed if the code base is reused for different projects.
- Group C has been renamed (Requiems, Libera -> Requiems). Accordingly, WerW C.5 has been renumbered to D.3.6, which has shifted former D.3.6/7 to D.3.7/8.
- WerW B.75 has been reclassified as spurious work and thus has been renumbered to B.S6. Accordingly, WerW B.76–78 have been renumbered to WerW B.75–77.
- WerW D.1.5 has been reclassified as offertory and thus has been renumbered to D.2.6. Accordingly, the following works have been renumbered: WerW D.1.6–17 to 5–16, and D.2.6–9 to 7–10.
- WerW D.1.8 has been renamed and thus could be merged with D.2.L7. Accordingly, WerW D.2.L8/9 have been renumbered to D.2.L7/8.
- WerW J.6 has been reclassified as spurious work and thus has been renumbered to J.S1. Accordingly, WerW J.7 has been renumbered to WerW J.6.

### Fixed

- identifiers in metadata of WerW B.46 and Q.2
- Ensembles are now correctly sorted (soli always before coro). Moreover, the soli ensemble is renamed to solo if only a single voice participates in a movement.

### Added

- manual incipits for WerW B.48, F.19/20/43, I.1.1, I.2.4, I.4.35, and Q.4.

- The catalogue now also comprises spurious and lost works (with incipits where known).
- The catalogue now comprises four reference columns: HarIn (Hárich 1975), PetWe (Petermayr 2015), PetSi (Petermayr 2020), and WinMa (Winkler-Klement 2020). These are linked to the bibliography.
- The overview table now includes the number of total, ascertained, lost, and spurious works in each group.
- A new chapter now describes the scope of work metadata. This chapter complements the more technical guidelines, which have thus been moved to the appendix.

### Changed

- Partitas from the Instrumental-Calender now have separate entries WerW O.1 to O.12.
- Accordingly, WerW O.2 was renumbered to O.13.

- Incipits are now specified without file extension in MEI files.
- Work details are now wider to accommodate wide tables.
- The following groups were renamed: E (German church arias -> German sacred music), I (Marian antiphons -> Marian hymns), and L (Profane cantatas -> Profane vocal music).
