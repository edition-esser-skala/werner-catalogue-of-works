## Work

- *titles*: title and language; several titles may be entered
  - *alternative title*: for works with several named movements (responsories like WerW D.3.7, vespers like WerW H.1.8); use a bullet and spaces (“ · ”) as separator
- *identification*
  - WerW: number according to this catalogue
  - Dopf: thematic catalogue of masses by @Dopf1956
  - HarCa: thematic catalogue (unfinished) by @Harich1990
  - HarIn: Werner's inventory of 1737/38 (H-Bn Acta mus. 4251; prefixes I–XIII) and thematic catalogue of 1740 (prefixes A–G) as described by @Harich1975
  - PetSi: catalogue of instrumental works by @Petermayr2020 (Kon: Konzerte; Par: Partiten; Pas: Pastorellen (geistlich); Sin: Sinfonien; Sog: Sonaten (geistlich); Sow: Sonaten (weltlich))
  - PetWe: catalogue of Christmas music by @Petermayr2015
  - WinMa: catalogue of masses by @WinklerKlement2020
- *contributors*: composer with GND ID; use “unknown” for spurious attributions

## Sources

### Manuscripts

Enter the following source details:

- *source title*: one of
  - “Autograph manuscript”
  - “Partly autograph manuscript”
  - “Manuscript copy”
- *classification*: add six terms from the predefined list
- *publication*:
  - date of writing
  - always include it, even if it is only a rough estimate, e.g.
    - mid 18th century (machine-readable 1750-01-01)

![](images/mermeid_sources_manuscript_1.png)

Then, add a **single item**:

- location
  - RISM siglum
  - URI (link to digitized version and/or catalogue entry; several links are supported)
  - label (“digitized version” or “catalogue entry”)
  - shelfmark
- other identifiers: “RISM” with ID

![](images/mermeid_sources_manuscript_2.png)

If a full score or all parts are described, enter the following information on the item level:

- title page with label (like “[fol. 1r, by Kiesewetter]”, “[wrapper]”, “[on binding]” etc)
  - use multiple title pages if appropriate
- physical description
  - extent (number of parts or number of folios/pages for full scores)
  - dimensions (height and width)
  - list of hands
    - hand is the full name; unknown writers are denoted “unidentified”
    - medium is selected from list
    - type may be changed (e.g., if a scribe only wrote the title)
    - person is deleted
  - physical medium
    - usually “hand-ruled paper, 8–12 staves” or similar
    - if there are several sets of parts, omit dimensions above and write details here (e.g., WerW I.3.3: “two sets of parts: [newline] (1) autograph manuscript, ca. 1760, 8 parts, 16 x 22 cm, hand-ruled paper, 5 staves (10 mm) [newline] (2) manuscript copy, ca. 1790, 8 parts, 15 x 22 cm, hand-ruled paper, 5 staves (10 mm)”)
- general description
  - individual parts with number of written pages in parentheses, e.g.,
    “S coro (2), A coro (2), T solo and coro (4), B coro (2), vl 1 (3), vl 2 (3), vlne (2), org (3)”
  - include any additional notes as new paragraph
  - if only data from the RISM entry and/or literature were used, write “catalogued according to RISM entry and @Muranyi1997” or similar


![](images/mermeid_sources_manuscript_3.png)

### Lost manuscripts

- *source title*: “Lost manuscript”
- *classification*: last term must be “Lost”
- add a single item:
  - location (use “Repository name” if no RISM siglum is available)
  - (optional) general description


### Prints

Enter the following source details:

- *source title*: “Print”
- *classification*: add six terms from the predefined list
- *publication*:
  - publisher
  - place
  - date of printing (mandatory)

![](images/mermeid_sources_print_1.png)

Also, add the following information on the source level (see manuscripts for details):

- RISM identifier
- title page(s)
- physical description (extent, dimensions, physical medium)
- general description

![](images/mermeid_sources_print_2.png)

Then, add **several items** where only the *location* is specified:

- RISM siglum
- URI (link to digitized version or catalogue entry)
- label (“digitized version” or “catalogue entry”)
- shelfmark

![](images/mermeid_sources_print_3.png)

::: {.callout-warning}
In the XML file, manually remove the `m:` prefix and namespace declaration from the `<physMedium>` tag.

## History

- *creation* (required)

  - place of composition; use a parenthesized question mark to indicate assumed place, e.g. “Eisenstadt (?)”
- *performances* (optional)
  - date
  - venue
  - location


![](images/mermeid_history.png)

## Bibliography

- Add a single bibliography with default header “Bibliography”.
- Manually add bibliographic references and modern editions as XML code. Each entry is represented by a `<bibl>` element that contains one `<genre>` and one `<ref>` tag. The latter tag points to a reference using [Pandoc Citations](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citation-syntax) format (also see [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/citations.html)).

    ```xml
    <bibl>
      <genre>reference</genre>
      <ref targettype="pandoc-citation">@Petermayr2020 [p. 23]</ref>
    </bibl>
    <bibl>
      <genre>reference</genre>
      <ref targettype="pandoc-citation">@Mikusi2020</ref>
    </bibl>
    <bibl>
      <genre>reference</genre>
      <ref targettype="pandoc-citation">@WinklerKlement2013 [p. 50]</ref>
    </bibl>
    <bibl>
      <genre>edition</genre>
      <ref targettype="pandoc-citation">@Schmid1940</ref>
    </bibl>
    ```
